### Delightful Weather

The proposed conference is scheduled to be a seven day event, beginning 14 December through 20 December 2025. You will enjoy a pleasant winter in Shenzhen, and have chance to visit many dynamic cities such as Gangdong (29 min by high speed train), Hong Kong (18 min by high speed train) and Macau and Zhuhai (by ferry or through the world's longest bridge) with your family in the Greater Bay Area. You will have an unforgetable new year holiday with your family.

### Diverse Team 

We propose an organizing team that already covers the key roles, including three honorary chairs, four General Chairs, five Program Chairs, two Finance Chairs and three Local Arrangement Chairs from the Americas, Asia-Pacific Region and Europe. Young talents are well represented on the team, who will work closely with the senior members in organizing the conference and preparing a high-quality program.
